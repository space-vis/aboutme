        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h4>Welcome to my about me. I made this because of character limits.</h4>
        I'm Joris, also known as SpaceVis or Feesh (with however many e's can fit), and I'm just your regular male from the Netherlands (HAGELSLAG IS GEWELDIG, NET ALS FRIKANDELLEN!!!).<br>
        First things first: <b>I am under 18 and have absolutely no interest in online dating.</b> (Why is it almost required to say this in the current day and age?)<br>
        Now that that's clear, here's my amazing and utterly perfect about me. (send help)<br>
        <br>
        I love reading, gaming, programming and chess. I mostly enjoy science fiction books, but books like the LotR-series are also enjoyable. I don't really have a preference when it comes to gaming. I've built up a passion for Undertale and FNaF, and play Asphalt Legends, Rayman and Minecraft on the side. I have (kinda?) mastered Scratch and Python, and know a bit of HTML and CSS. Chess is a way for me to relax, and watching others giving me free queens is also very entertaining. (I'm looking at you, Martin.)<br>
        I can really enjoy talking to people! You can contact me at any time on Discord (spacevis_yt) or by email (8p7zhag1e@mozmail.com), and I'll be there if you ask me to join your game. At least, if it's not like 40 bucks on Steam.<br>
        And yes, I'm a tech nerd. Ask me to help diagnose a problem with your PC, and with the help of Google and ChatGPT it'll be fixed in no time.<br>
        <br>
        If you have any more questions, or just want to get to know me better, feel free to send me a DM! :D
